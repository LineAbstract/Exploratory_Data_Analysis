# Exploratory_Data_Analysis Part 1
Exploratory Data Analysis with SQL, Pandas and Matplotlib

Data Source: 
- Connecting to a remotely hosted mySQL database instance

- (2.5 points): As a Data Analyst, I want to set up the proper imports so I have access to the Pandas, Matplotlib, and MySQL Connector Python libraries
- (2.5 points): As a Data Analyst, I want to use MySQL Connector to establish a connection to my remote data source
    - HINT: Check the Setup Steps for information about the credentials you will use for connecting
- (5 points): As a Data Analyst, I want to query my database to JOIN the information from the sales and cities tables together, and save the result as a single DataFrame variable
- (10 points): As a Data Analyst, I want to perform the necessary data cleaning and wrangling steps for my DataFrame.  This will include:
    - Exploring the information of the joined DataFrame
    - Checking for and removing null values, if necessary
    - Checking for and removing duplicate rows, if necessary
    - Converting any necessary columns to Pandas DateTime format
- (15 points): As a Data Analyst, I want to explore my DataFrame to examine the spread of values across categories.  I will utilize this exploration to answer the following questions:
    - How many sales were made for members vs. normal customers?
    - How many sales were made at each store location?
    - How many sales were made for each product line?
    - What is the overall average rating, based on all sales records?
- (15 points): As a Data Analyst, I want to create three visualizations of my DataFrame to better understand any trends or patterns within my data set.  These charts will be a type of my choosing, and I can select which variables to analyze.  All three charts should contain the following:
    - A chart title
    - X-axis labels, if applicable
    - Y-axis labels, if applicable

# Exploratory_Data_Analysis Part 2
- (2.5 points): As a Data Analyst, I want to set up the proper imports so I have access to the scikit-learn Python library
- (2.5 points): As a Data Analyst, I want to describe numeric trends in my DataFrame, using the appropriate Pandas function
- (2.5 points): As a Data Analyst, I want to explore the correlation between columns of my data set, using the appropriate Pandas function
- (5 points): As a Data Analyst, I want to note the columns with the strongest correlation, and visualize those two columns using a Matplotlib Scatter Plot. I will ensure my plot includes the following:
    - A chart title
    - An X-axis label
    - A Y-axis label
- (5 points): As a Data Analyst, I want to reshape my two columns to prepare for fitting to a linear regression model, and save each as its own unique variable
- (5 points): As a Data Analyst, I want to create a new LinearRegression instance, and use the appropriate function to create a predictive model for my Y-axis values.
- (10 points): As a Data Analyst, I want to create a visualization of my predictive model, and ensure I include the following stylizations:
    - A chart title
    - X-axis label
    - Y-axis label
    - A different color line for my predictive model
- (15 points): As a Data Analyst, I want to present my findings as a Level I-style video recording (informal) that is no more than 5-8 minutes and covers the following:
    - The completed results of your Jupyter notebook
    - Key visualizations generated based off of evaluation questions
    - Any other cleaned/wrangled supporting data 
    - Communicate any insights youâ€™ve gathered by working with the data
    - Make sure to address a specific individual in your video as if you were responding to a request for analysis (you can pick a fictional person or choose an instructor!)
